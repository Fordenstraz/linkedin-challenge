								Honey bees go out in search of flowers, to
								gather pollen from. When they find a large group
								of flowers they will return to their hive and
								perform the "Waggle". The "Waggle" is a dance
								performed in a figure-8 shape. It tells their
								other bee friends that they've found a jackpot
								of pollen. Then a whole possy of bees will head
								over to the flowers, gather more pollen, and
								create more honey.

								A bee beats their wings 11,400 times a minute!
								That is nearly 200 times per second. Each bee
								hive can create around 45kg (about 100 pounds)
								of honey a year. Not bad, for having brains the
								size of poppy seeds!

								It sounds totally weird but it's true. In
								addition to their two big eyes (one on each side
								of the head) bees also have three eyes (know as
								"ocelli") on the tops of their heads. These eyes
								don't see as well but they can detect changes in
								light.
