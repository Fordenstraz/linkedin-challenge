The "Waggle" is a dance performed in a figure-8 shape. It tells their other bee friends that they`ve found a jackpot of pollen. Then a whole possy of bees will head over to the flowers, gather up a bunch of pollen, and create even more honey!',

	title: 'Hustle, Hustle, Hustle',
	body: 'A bee beats their wings 11,400 times a minute! That is nearly 200 times per second. Each beehive can create around 45kg (about 100 pounds) of honey a year. Not bad, for having brains the size of poppy seeds!',

	title: 'Eyes On The Back Of Your Head!',
	body: 'It sounds totally weird but it`s true. In addition to their two big eyes (one on each side of the head) bees also have three eyes (know as "ocelli") on the tops of their heads. These eyes don`t see as well but they can detect changes in light.',
